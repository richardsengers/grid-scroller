# GridScroller

**Initial setup**

* Create environment with Angular CLI, which includes angular 8.2.4 and Ivy for compilation
* Add Bootstrap for column layout. Only include the sass files which are needed
* Create public url on Araneum to get images in JSON format from our DAM
* Add ngx-virtual-scroll for virtual scrolling
* Add ng2-tooltip-directive to show a tooltip when hovering on a tile

**Finalizing**
* Still need to add some working tests. Will describe and update them in a next release
* Improvements; somehow the latest version of the cli and angular don't render the page right when making changes to the html templates. I've never seen it before and I haven't figured out what's causing this issue. It only affects developement.
* Improvements; Layout can be better designed ;-)
